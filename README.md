# split-words

The file contains the implementation for the following problem, in a recursive manner:

Given a list of words and a string made up of those words (no spaces), return the original sentence in a list.
If there is more than one possible reconstruction, return any of them.
If there is no possible reconstruction, then return an empty array.
For example:
Given the set of words 'quick', 'brown', 'the', 'fox', and the string "thequickbrownfox", you should return ['the', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox'].
Given the set of words 'bed', 'bath', 'bedbath', 'and', 'beyond', and the string "bedbathandbeyond", return either ['bed', 'bath', 'and', 'beyond] or ['bedbath', 'and', 'beyond'].
Try to use functional programming concepts like higher order functions and immutability.
Bonus points if you write some unit tests to prove your implementation is correct.
